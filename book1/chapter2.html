<p><em>Seven months ago</em></p>
<p>The waves lapped onto the shore of the private beach, pulling the mind into a peaceful repose.
Seagulls could be heard overhead, far enough for their cries to be enjoyed without being so close that they were a threat to any of the food here.
It was idyllic.
Transcendent.
Benjamin Quick&apos;s head was nestled on the chest of Thaddeus &quot;Ted&quot; Easterly, and he was sure he had never been so happy in his life.</p>
<p>After the past three years together, they had taken this retreat alone.
Sure, it had been enjoyable distributing so many banners and running the last true resistance against the forces of US Soccer.
But there were limits to how much joy one could get from building a presence as an influencer on the dime of a cosmopolitan billionaire.
This weekend would be the moment where Ben&apos;s life would change forever.</p>
<p>He&apos;d been half-dozing off, but at that thought he suddenly felt his pulse quicken.
It took an effort not to spasm.
He craned his head up and looked at Ted.
The timing wasn&apos;t &quot;right&quot;, but hell- when had he ever worried about timing in his life?
Moderation was for others- in this moment, he felt he had to move forward.</p>
<p>He fumbled into the pockets of his shorts and grabbed a small box.
&quot;Babe,&quot; he said, tracing his finger along Ted&apos;s chest.</p>
<p>&quot;Mmmm?&quot; Ted murmured, breathing a little more deeply.</p>
<p>&quot;I need to ask you something,&quot; Ben said, struggling to get the words out smoothly as he moved off of Ted&apos;s chest.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; Ted asked, getting up and stretching.</p>
<p>Ben went down to one knee and opened the ring box. 
&quot;Hon, I... will you marry me?&quot;</p>
<p>Ted went silent for a moment, eyes bulging. 
&quot;I...&quot;</p>
<p>Ben bit his lip, eyes misting a little. 
He was a little scared, but he knew that after all their time together, after all the hashtags they&apos;d built, that the answer could never be in doubt.
&quot;I love you,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I... are you out of your mind?!&quot; Ted yelled, practically spitting.</p>
<p>&quot;What?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You want to go <em>single-entity</em> with me?&quot; Ted continued, stomping furiously.</p>
<p>Ben&apos;s jaw dropped.
&quot;Hon, this isn&apos;t-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All of this time we&apos;ve spent building an <em>open system</em> where poor performance was harshly dealt with.
It&apos;s the one constant of my life, Ben.
I don&apos;t tolerate closed systems for my soccer.
I don&apos;t tolerate closed systems for my government.
And I don&apos;t tolerate closed systems in my relationships!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But... we said we&apos;re always committed to-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To our partnership and the best ideas,&quot; Ted reprimanded.
&quot;If there could be a better idea in all things than the principle of promotion and relegation, then I would promote it to my first priority.
But there isn&apos;t.
You just betrayed the one constant, Ben.
It&apos;s over.&quot; Ted stomped off towards the cabin.</p>
<p>Ben panicked and chased after him.
&quot;Wait- of course I made a mistake here.
We can patch this up.
We can continue the way it was!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You tried to breakaway from our system.
I&apos;m points deducting you and relegating you back out of my life.&quot;
Ted finished packing and zipped up his suitcase, heading for the door. When he got there, he turned.
&quot;In a year or three though... I could see you promoting your way back into my top flight, though.&quot;</p>
<p>Ted walked out the door, leaving Ben agape. <em>What just happened?</em></p>
