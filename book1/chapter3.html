<p><em>The present, or whatever time this is set in anyway, look, the point is that this is seven months after that previous chapter</em></p>
<p>Alexi Noruhl took his laptop to his local Buffalo Wild Wings, set to begin his war against the A.N.A.L.
After finishing his meal, he took out the laptop and set it up at the bar, nursing another pint as he worked.
He plugged in the USB security key that would automatically connect his laptop on a secure tunnel back to US Soccer&apos;s internal networks, then navigated to birdsite.io.
He began a new thread, and began to work the magic that US Soccer&apos;s Special Projects Division paid him so highly for.
Some people said it was nonsense, but what they failed to understand was that as long as the check cleared, anything could make sense.</p>
<pre><code>BIRDSITE.IO
ENTER COMMAND &gt; NEW
</code></pre><p>A lot of people here are saying that they&apos;re excited for ANAL and for the possibilities that ANAL has for all of US Soccer. 
These people think that all of our other leagues should be forced into promotion and relegation, possibly against their will.</p>
<p>But this is wrong. 
This is America. 
Sure, pro/rel is a great principle, but why should anyone be forced into it against their will? 
We&apos;ve built our own system here and it&apos;s working great for some folks.</p>
<p>When they built it, all they did was agree with FIFA that in exchange for hosting the world cup in the US, that a first-division league with promotion and relegation would be established. 
But they never said when it would be ready by, or which owners would assemble it.</p>
<p>So now ANAL is coming to do this. 
Great! 
This is their opportunity to build a better mousetrap. 
We could always just do two things. 
Some people would say that this is wrong, that it&apos;s overcomplicated, that we only need one system.</p>
<p>But if that was true, why do kids love Rube Goldberg so much? 
I used to see Rube Goldberg machines in Tom and Jerry cartoons growing up and they were classic. 
I truly think the best way you could grow the game in this country is to make the Rube Goldberg of divisional structures.</p>
<p>This new thing with promotion and relegation can have its own championships and interact using the US Open Cup, and everything can operate on their own separate schedules and rules and occasionally barely interact, kicking off a chain reaction of soccer.</p>
<p>The result will be a finely tuned machine where figuring out how it works will be just as interesting as what the machine produces. 
If you&apos;ve ever watched How It&apos;s Made, that&apos;s a winning formula. 
And that&apos;s what I&apos;m proposing we build here.</p>
<p>I don&apos;t want anyone to be forced to do something they wouldn&apos;t like. 
I wouldn&apos;t want to be forced to get rid of my mousetraps, and then go to the store, and buy even more mousetraps, just because you like your new model better!</p>
<p>Especially not after all of the peanut butter I just applied to these ones. 
We have to take care of these investors- if we were to send them down a division, it would be the equivalent of lighting some of their mousetraps on fire, which could light their house on fire.</p>
<p>And frankly, with the kind of cheap construction materials we&apos;ve been using, the US Soccer neighborhood could go up in smoke at that point.</p>
<p>Protect America.
Protect Soccer.</p>
<p>Leave our mousetraps alone.</p>

</code></pre><p>Alexi nodded, satisfied, then unplugged the security key and set it down for a moment as he began to pack up his laptop.</p>
<p>&quot;This is ridiculous,&quot; the man next to him said.
&quot;Why would I ever watch this crap soccer on the TV when there&apos;s no connection with the lower leagues?&quot;</p>
<p>Something within Alexi stirred.
Business meetings around TV ratings and how to increase them came back to his mind.
This could be a potential customer.
He had a rare opportunity to do some in-person market research.
He turned his head to look at who spoke, then came up short.</p>
<p>The man next to him was a relatively average-looking white male.
The beginnings of a 5 o&apos;clock shadow on his face.
Standard haircut stuffed underneath a ballcap with no team or logo on it.
In other words, breathtaking.
Alexi struggled to remember what he was going to say.</p>
<p>&quot;You see it, right?&quot; the man next to him asked.
&quot;If this top league is just its own thing but isn&apos;t <em>directly</em> connected with everything below, there&apos;s just not nearly as many compelling stories.
But you connect it all up- probably 10 times as many people would have a reason to watch that championship. Maybe 100.&quot;</p>
<p>The words produced a chaos of emotion within Alexi. 
They sounded wrong, and yet for all that, he could feel an explosion of new ideas bubbling up within him.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes... I think, I think you might be right,&quot; Noruhl said.
Noticing his conversation partner&apos;s empty glass, he flagged down the bartender.
&quot;Can I buy you another round?&quot; he asked.</p>
<p>&quot;By all means. 
Name&apos;s Ted.&quot; 
They shook hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Alexi. Glad to meet you, Ted. 
I&apos;m looking forward to some great intercourse with you.&quot;
He choked.
&quot;Er, discouse.&quot;</p>
<p>Ted lifted a single eyebrow, taking a sip from his new pint.</p>
