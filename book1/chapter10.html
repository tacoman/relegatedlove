<p>&quot;Papa, I do not understand why we are doing this.&quot; 
The boy manned the turret of their state-of-the-art urban assault vehicle, scanning back and forth for potential issues.</p>
<p>&quot;Is very simple,&quot; George said as he drove.
&quot;We have been very disrespected by this Alliance.
Before that, we were disrespected by these rouge people.
And before that, by Europe.&quot;
He wrinkled his nose and thought for a moment. He&apos;d missed something.
&quot;After Europe, by the NCAA insisting that we were cheating their by-laws.
And frankly we have been disrespected by everyone we have ever done business with.
If we want a better deal for you as a player we have to get into this new system that is coming.
They will respect us.
And if they don&apos;t, I will find a new place that will.
After all, there is always more soccer somewhere.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, Papa,&quot; the boy replied.
&quot;Only, what are we doing driving the UAV into the city at this late hour, and what does any of that have to do with soccer deals?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We built a new stadium&quot;, George said.
&quot;They have this old one.
We destroy the stadium as part of the deal, and then everybody respects us for it.
No more rouge, and thus we will own the entire market here.
Everyone will have to see LP White Dwarves play, and you as our shining star.&quot;</p>
<p>The boy nodded. &quot;Yes, father, I understand that, such as it goes... but why is our UAV covered in corn?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Any police stop us, they believe we are simple grocery delivery.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Truly, papa?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, not remotely,&quot; George said, pulling into the historic stadium.
&quot;Corn is marketing obligation for crossover appeal from birdsite poll.&quot;
The boy cocked his head, but before he could ask what this meant, a loud THUMP rocked the UAV.</p>
<p>The boy swung the turret towards the noise.
&quot;Papa,&quot; he shouted, &quot;a large man wearing a Sailor Moon outfit has just landed on the tank!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well do not simply report it then! 
Shoot the asshole!&quot; George yelled back.
&quot;They certainly didn&apos;t pay us enough to <em>not</em> shoot at him!&quot;</p>
<p>The boy desperately tried to fire at the interloper, only to have the man improbably leap out of the way each time.</p>
<p>&quot;Ayyyy lmao!&quot; he yelled, cartwheeling away from the shots.</p>
<p>&quot;That is so cringy!&quot; the boy yelled trying and failing to fire again.
&quot;Papa, we&apos;re out of ammo already! 
We&apos;re fucked!
This tank is fucked!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, not yet,&quot; the man in the sailor scout uniform replied.</p>
<p>&quot;We still have trick up sleeve,&quot; George said.
&quot;Initiate humanoid transformation!&quot;</p>
<p>All at once, the tank suddenly began to morph into a humanoid form uncannily resembling an oversized anime girl.
And yet, one could not help feeling like they were still looking at a tank personified, or to wonder where some of the corn cobs had gone.</p>
<p>&quot;I think I&apos;m going to feel sick,&quot; the boy said, collapsed into a heap from being shaken all around by the machine&apos;s full configuration.
&quot;I&apos;m stuck down here in the leg now!
What am I supposed to do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Was never about you,&quot; George said from the newly created cockpit.
&quot;This is my moment.&quot;
He shifted a lever and the tank/girl walked forward, extending a hand.
&quot;Do not believe it is you who will be fucking tank today, buddy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not quite so fast!&quot; another Clooney-esque voice rang out.</p>
<p>George scanned backwards, then saw the figure standing atop the wall of the east grandstands.
&quot;That cannot-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&apos;s right&quot;, the voice said. 
&quot;I&apos;m the world&apos;s greatest cowled detective, and thanks to trademark law I&apos;m not going to say any more than that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are you going to do, throw an awkwardly-shaped boomerang at us?&quot; the boy scoffed from his spot in the leg.</p>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; the detective said, pulling out a credit card with the image of a flying mammal on it.
&quot;I used this to hire somebody even more powerful than myself.&quot;</p>
<p><em>BOW! KRONK! SPLAT!</em> the UAV began to sway under the impact of a series of blows from another cowled figure who had arrived from the west.</p>
<p>&quot;We&apos;re much the same,&quot; the original cowled detective mused, &quot;except that one isn&apos;t bound by any rules of logic.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Papa, we&apos;re hosed!&quot; the boy said.</p>
<p>&quot;Not quite true. Chapter has been taking long time to write, and any moment now-&quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly, the newcomer froze up.</p>
<p>&quot;End of episode narration- he&apos;s run out of his 30 minute TV window. 
Won&apos;t be the same time or same place for you,&quot; George said, using a leg to kick the interloper clear out of the stadium.</p>
<p>&quot;And now that we&apos;ve dealt with him, we can mop up the rest and-&quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly a pair of lasers flashed out of the nearby dumpster, puncturing straight through all of the tank girl&apos;s armor and causing it to violently explode.
Everyone froze.</p>
<p>&quot;What was that?&quot; asked the sailor scout quietly.</p>
<p>&quot;Dumpster bear,&quot; the remained detective stated.
&quot;Woken up by the impacts of the fighting, no doubt.
I wouldn&apos;t worry about him waking up again- they can&apos;t hear you because their ears aren&apos;t real.&quot;</p>
<p>The sailor scout nodded.
&quot;If I&apos;m being honest, I was hoping the tank girl would reject its pilots and achieve sentience.
Would have given her my number.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We all were, son&quot;, the detective said. &quot;Every single one of us hoped for that.&quot;</p>
