<p>The most powerful men in United States soccer met on a chilly February evening, gathered around a table with a holographic projector.
The group was often accused of being an old boys&apos; club, but that was hardly fair- some of these men were relatively young, after all.
They ran through the droll details of the group&apos;s finances, scarfing down an impressive spread of McDonald&apos;s as the figures ran past.
It was generally allocated across the entire group, with classics like the Whopper (TM) alongside new items like the Spicy Chicken Nuggets with Mighty Hot Sauce (TM), with gallons of Diet Coke to go around.</p>
<p>Finally the charts wrapped up- the projector&apos;s ability to display 3D imagery correctly to all viewing angles was a technological marvel, but perhaps wasted on showing spreadsheets to disinterested stakeholders.
Commissioner Donovan Grabber cleared his throat.
&quot;Gentleman,&quot; he said, &quot;It is now time to turn to the real order of business today.&quot;
With a click of a button, the projector flipped to a map of the United States with each of their major franchises highlighted in blue, demonstrating their command of the market.
&quot;For some time now, our dominance has been virtually unchallenged.
Whatever we want from a market, we take.
Sometimes our marketers simply take over a market entirely.
But as of last night... we are under threat.&quot;</p>
<p>With another click of the button, a series of red dots appeared in the hologram.
&quot;These are the new teams of the newly formed Autonomous National Alliance of Leagues. 
A would-be resistance movement that believes they can upend the rules of our system and institute a system of promotion and relegation.
It is antithetical to everything we have done to Hashtag Grow The Game (TM) and exercise our complete control over the system.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Promotion and relegation in the United Statesssss,&quot; hissed a hooded figure from one end of the table, &quot;would be the most seismic event in world hisssstory.
It would change the entire world overnight.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Correct,&quot; Grabber said. 
&quot;Our entire mission is to curate the sport in this country in a way that preserves the geopolitical status quo.
If the Alliance succeeds, it is impossible to tell what the consequences would be for nation states around the world.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sssssporting dominance,&quot; the hooded figure hissed further.
&quot;Buy-in with the national teaaam.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you quite done?&quot; Grabber asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Latinoooos,&quot; the figure hissed.</p>
<p>&quot;What threat could they possibly pose?&quot; asked one of the owners around the table.
&quot;Let&apos;s just simply use our normal playbook- buy a few teams here, fauxmote a team there, and use rumors to hinder the momentum of the rest.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;m afraid the situation is advancing quickly,&quot; Grabber said.
&quot;Several teams in the league have already begun using Hashtag Pro Rel For USA banners.&quot;</p>
<p>Several gasps and murmurs went around the table.
A lower-league team that refused to say Hashtag Pro Rel For USA was doomed from the start, as had been proven through decades of experience.
Every single one that didn&apos;t do it had folded.
But it was a slowly spreading secret that by simply using the words, a team could protect itself from all manner of market calamities.
It was modern-day magic distilled into banner form. m
Market fundamentals and revenues would take a backseat to using the correct memetic invocations.</p>
<p>&quot;All they need to do is get 60 owners who are willing to take repeated losses in unpredictable market conditions, and I&apos;m afraid they&apos;ll be able to institute an internal pyramid to counter ours.
From there it&apos;s simply a hop skip and a jump to overturning our closed system and enforcing open access, unleashing the most devastating tides of history.
Regimes would change.
Wars could begin overnight- or even end.
And we are the only ones who can stop it,&quot; Grabber said, taking a long draw from his Diet Coke straw until it began to make that obnoxious open air suckling noise.
He swished the straw around a little to get what was left at the bottom of the cup, finally admitting that he would need to go refill it as he popped off the top.</p>
<p>&quot;What do we have to counteract this?&quot; one of the owners asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Unfortunately not much,&quot; Grabber lamented as he feathered the Coke button, trying to get as much into the cup as possible while letting the fizz die down.
&quot;Billions of dollars of pooled assets.
Almost exclusive media access in dozens of markets.
FIFA officials who rule overwhelmingly in our favor due to their tendency to find unmarked bags of cash after trips to Brazilian steakhouses.
Case law precedents that ruled in our favor despite explicit rules stating otherwise.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Asssssassssssinnssssssss,&quot; the hooded figure hissed.</p>
<p>&quot;The New York double agents are no longer able to take to the field,&quot; Grabber corrected.</p>
<p>&quot;It&apos;s hopeless!&quot; one owner wailed.
&quot;They have us flanked on every front!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We could rebrand!&quot; chimed in another.</p>
<p>&quot;Shuffle some teams around,&quot; someone said, clutching a pair of 40-sided dice.</p>
<p>This continued for several minutes, with Commissioner Grabber desperately attempting to call order to the situation with his dozens of bosses.
Finally, one man stood up.
&quot;Boys, I do believe this is where I come in,&quot; he beamed proudly.</p>
<p>A hush fell around the rest of the room.
Alexi Noruhl, the hero of many a social media campaign, was one of the few who could command enough respect in this group of people to take charge.
&quot;It&apos;s true that their business model allows them to create new teams even more quickly than they dissolve,&quot; Alexi said.
&quot;They have a bunch of hastily printed banners that distort our ability to use blunt-force market trauma to win a game of Ayn Rand&apos;s Battlespreadsheets against them.
But do they have a former World Cup player who is willing to use misleading analogies about mouse traps on Twitter?&quot;</p>
<p>The murmuring returned, but this time it had a positive sound to it as people saw hope.
&quot;Do they have anyone who can look at a simple structure that has worked around the globe, and instead suggest an overly complicated alternative that has never happened anywhere else?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Speak on, Alexi!&quot; shouted one man, a series of hands beating on the table in support.</p>
<p>&quot;Do they have the budget to have someone sit on the web all day and make disingenuous arguments!&quot; Noruhl practically shouted, drunk on the momentum.</p>
<p>&quot;They do have fans who pretend to work in offices- oof!&quot; one dissenter suggested, shortly before being elbowed and shushed.</p>
<p>&quot;Worry not,&quot; Noruhl said soothingly. 
&quot;As underresourced as we are- as big of a threat to the game as this is- I will not allow them to ruin our system.
I will strike them where it hurts,&quot; he paused.
The room shook with collective anticipation, held near the edge.</p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;m going to tweet them into thinking they don&apos;t even want it,&quot; Noruhl finished with a grin.
The energy in the room reached its climax, a thunderous applause as dozens of fleshy hands noisily expressed their ecstasy for their red-maned savior.
If this new Alliance thought it would be easy to overcome a room of scrappy billionaires, they were sorely mistaken.</p>
