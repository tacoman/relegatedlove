<p>Alexi woke up the next day and reflexively checked his bank account statement to see if payroll had processed.
As long as the check cleared, anything could make sense.
As long as the money kept rolling in, any position could get into his brain and he could argue it with perfect confidence.
But this morning, the bank statements didn&apos;t add up.
He kept checking the deposit column over and over, but it said the same thing every time.
Or rather, it didn&apos;t say it.</p>
<p>For the first time in years, the pundit payments had not hit.
The feeling was like a vise unscrewing itself from his brain, releasing it, as he was able to see the world freshly again.
Forced to come to terms with his own ideals, the things he had believed the past 30 years, he realized what a horrible mistake he&apos;d made and trembled.</p>
<p>For years he&apos;d been arguing strictly in favor of the tops of the system.
For single entity, no need for relegation to threaten positions. 
No need for it to threaten <em>his</em> position.
He&apos;d been raking in the dough to put an illegitimate face on this idea.
But now that it wasn&apos;t there, he had to be honest with himself.</p>
<p>He&apos;d argued years against the bottom of the system having any rights- but in his heart, wasn&apos;t he one of those bottoms?
Wasn&apos;t that where he felt that true power came from?
What he&apos;d been yearning to feel for years now?
And here, he knew that he&apos;d had a chance for it last night with Ted, but instead had chosen to sell out yet again.
He&apos;d perverted Ted&apos;s ideas by passing on a twisted form of them to his bosses for pay- and in so doing, had perverted himself.</p>
<p>He dialed the number that he had gotten from Ted the night before.
No answer.
He walked out of his hotel room, dialing again frantically.
Still no answer.
He put himself into a light jog, trying to work the nervous energy out of his system.
Ted had to still be in the city somewhere.
He had to apologize, come clean, and find a way to undo it.</p>
<p>He could join the alliance.
Yes, that would do it.
The siren song of ANAL was calling out to him, and if he could just push his way through, would be the perfect home for his tumescent self.</p>
<p>But first he had to clear things up.
He stopped jogging for a moment, dialed Ted once more.
This time, he picked up.</p>
<p>&quot;You rotten son of a bitch,&quot; the voice on the other end yelled.</p>
<p><em>How could he possibly know already?</em> Alexi wondered, heart racing.</p>
<p>&quot;I recognized who you were, but something in me sensed that maybe we were really kindred spirits, that I could get through to you,&quot; Ted continued.
&quot;But then I check out the leading journalism from the New York Event Horizons community, and what do I see?&quot;</p>
<p>Prime Squad Pod had somehow gotten wind of the story before anyone else. 
Of course. 
&quot;Babe, you&apos;ve gotta listen to me.
I know that it looks bad.
I know that I&apos;ve done wrong before.
But that was the old me.
You can&apos;t judge me based on things I did 24 hours ago while the money was good.
I&apos;ve changed now!
You can relegate me out of your life if I&apos;ve done bad, but doesn&apos;t that mean you have to promote me back in as soon as I do good?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As far as I&apos;m concerned, your treasonous ass should be placed in administration- and I know just the thing, Alexi-&quot;</p>
<p>On the other end of the line, Alexi heard a door come crashing open as Ted yelped. &quot;Ted?&quot; he said, heart churning into overdrive.</p>
<p>The phone dropped. 
A scuffle broke out and quickly ended as Ted violently screamed, dropping to the floor.
Then the phone was picked back up.</p>
<p>&quot;Ssssssssoooooooo,&quot; the assailant hissed into the phone.
&quot;If it isn&apos;t Lalassssss.&quot;</p>
<p>Alexi scowled. 
There was only one person who could have taken down his lover that quickly.
&quot;Benjamin Quick,&quot; he growled.</p>
<p>&quot;Alwayssssss.
If you want to sssssave your lover... come to the Fort Pontchartrain. 
Room 503. 
And come aloooooone, or I&apos;ll simply finish him off immediately.&quot;</p>
