                                <p>George fumbled open the door to room 401 as Larry Gary had told him to.
&quot;OK, I&apos;m here buddy.
Now what did you want... to...&quot;
George trailed off as he took in the sight before him. 
&quot;What is all of this?&quot;</p>
<p>The room was covered from top to bottom with pizzas.
Pizzas covered every square inch of floor.
The beds were loaded with pizzas.
Even the walls and ceiling were, improbably, laden with pizza- how they were staying on wasn&apos;t clear.
Not a single box was in sight.</p>
<p>And standing in the middle of it all was a stark naked Larry Gary, holding naught but the Coke that had clearly been influencing his behavior to this point.
&quot;Shhhh,&quot; Larry said, his well-seasoned breadstick ready with the telltale firmness of one slightly too baked.
&quot;We don&apos;t need any words.
All your previous betrayals were from mere handshake agreements.
But we can seal our working relationship with something far more meaningful.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We really shouldn&apos;t,&quot; George said, sweating as Larry went for the buttons on his shirt.
<em>What would my wife say about this debauchery</em>, he wondered, but couldn&apos;t quite say aloud.
His wife didn&apos;t have the vision for business that he did. 
That&apos;s all this was: business, with a side of revenge.</p>
<p>As the shirt came off and his belt was loosened, George couldn&apos;t help himself but to feel Larry&apos;s breadstick.
It was buttery smooth, and just the right size- it would go into his mouth so smoothly.
George had gone for many a breadstick in his younger years- he knew perfection when it was in front of him.
It was surprisingly dark, all things considered.
Possibly the result of a little too much time in the heat.</p>
<p>Distracted, he hardly even realized that his shoes and pants had all been removed until Larry suddenly marched him over to the pizzas and shoved him onto them, sliding them across the cheese in one smooth motion before leaning into a deep kiss.
Before he could even properly think about how out of order that had been, George jumped as he realized that Larry had started to touch his prized pepperoni roll.
Larry might have a wide array of pizzas with all toppings around him, but George was a stout Balkan man and knew that the cure for the deepest craving that humanity had was a stout, powerful Sudžuk sausage.</p>
<p>Larry Gary began to stroke the sausage more intently.
&quot;There&apos;s something... different about this,&quot; he murmured.
&quot;It&apos;s not your typical... that is, it feels like it&apos;s already filled with-&quot;</p>
<p>But in the meanwhile George had been transported back to his wilder younger days back in the old country.
Old times.
Old lovers.
In a moment he relived what had felt like an entire lifetime with a man who had proved to be another forbidden fruit- Colby Jack, who had seemingly always been semi-hard.</p>
<p>&quot;Jack,&quot; George sighed, as if in a trance.</p>
<p>&quot;Filled with jack?&quot; Larry Gary asked, frowning.
That was no state to leave a pepperoni in.
Larry squeezed with furor.
It was time for a good jack off if he was going to get this sausage to the state he really wanted it to be in.
He worked it up and down, giving it a few licks.
All told, it was really quite delicious.
He let more of it into his mouth, showing off the capacity that had made him the class hot dog eating champion 5 years in a row in school.</p>
<p>Finally, the pepperoni surrendered its delightful filling, to the delight of both participants.
It wasn&apos;t easy to do so- only the alertness conferred by consuming large amounts of Coke made it possible.
Every time it seemed like there couldn&apos;t be any more, another spurt happened.
It was enough to make him wonder if he&apos;d secretly worked through a calzone.</p>
<p>At long last the torrent of goo ended and Larry licked his lips, satisfied, as George gasped.
In 30 years of time with his wife, not once had she showed such aptitude at sausage handling as to leave it in such a state.
He opened his eyes and gazed at Larry Gary.
Both of them were simply covered in cheese now, but neither particularly cared. 
George allowed himself to roll over and settle into Larry&apos;s bought-and-paid-for sauce, marveling at what the juices did for his skin.</p>
<p>It wasn&apos;t long before Larry Gary decided that it was time for round two and for his breadstick to be handled.
With the wordless understanding that can only be expressed by two titans of business, Larry laid out a generous portion of oil onto George, then prepared for the difficult work of stuffing George&apos;s crust.
After all, why should his own stuffed cheesy bread be left in the lurch?
Filling transferral was no easy proposition, but Larry was a deft hand at pulling off doughy maneuvers.
And truth be told, once you had started in on them, you could hardly help but find it addictive to go for just one more- he was an adeptly practiced hand.</p>
<p>But even while ensuring a reciprocal unloading, Larry Gary couldn&apos;t help himself. 
While pumping his dispenser in and out to prepare for the crust stuffing, Larry gently stroked George&apos;s olives, dabbing the oil from them to his adjacent jalapeno.
He knew he had to be careful with this- it was possible to get too much heat- but he could barely help himself.
Finally, this all proved to be too much, and the crust was completely and utterly stuffed ahead of schedule.
There was a sense of timing to this, and he worried that he had simply loaded it up too quickly.
<em>I guess it&apos;s true what they say- nobody</em> does <em>do it like the Hut after all.</em>
He rolled over to the other side of the king-sized bed, limbs flopping against pizzas as he went.</p>
<p>Tragicomically, and saving the author from the duty of writing some unconvincing aftercare, a nude Cynthia Prism finally made it up to the room, holding on firmly to an early-2000s handheld entertainment system.
&quot;Looks like you boys started the dealmaking without me,&quot; she said, raising an eyebrow at the most catastrophic loss of a security deposit that had ever been made.</p>
<p>&quot;That was not my fault,&quot; George gasped, panicking.
Larry Gary was not the only man that he needed a deeper-than-a-handshake agreement with- the man&apos;s impatience might have cost him the best chance he had at her all-important anchovies!
This was a disaster!</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I suppose you boys could make it up to me,&quot; she said.
&quot;You owe me a double battle.&quot;</p>
<p>Both Larry Gary and George were surprised to find that they were already prepared to link cables again and participate in a trademark-free entanglement. 
After the brief preparation of a load screen and the button tapping of some menuing, the men&apos;s onyx&apos;s were able to quickly use harden and tackle her cloister, hammering away until a string shot finale as they retracted.</p>
<p>George passed out face first into the pizzas.
He had simply no idea how he would explain this depravity to his wife later.
But at long last, he had something so much deeper than a handshake deal with the highest levels of US Soccer.
Revenge would be his soon.</p>
