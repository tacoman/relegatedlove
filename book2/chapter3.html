                                <p>John looked at the expansion projection list, kneading his temple.
He was supposed to go on a podcast with 829 followers on Birdsite later this afternoon and discuss expansion, which would be a pivotal PR point before finalizing numbers with the league&apos;s sponsors to give a much-needed shot in the arm on revenue later.
The problem was that it was dubious whether <em>any</em> new teams would be starting this year and taking them above the national minimum of 8 teams in the league.
What on earth was he supposed to even say under these circumstances?</p>
<p>A knock sounded at the door.
&quot;Come in,&quot; John said.
Larry Gary entered the room and sat on the other side of his desk.
&quot;I&apos;m glad you&apos;re here,&quot; John said.
&quot;I could really use some of that Harvard brain of yours on this problem.&quot;</p>
<p>Larry craned his head to take a look at the monitor.
&quot;Not very many in the confirmed column, are there?&quot; he asked, frowning.</p>
<p>&quot;Not for this year,&quot; John said.
&quot;We have plenty of groups looking to play two seasons from now, but next year is pivotal if we&apos;re going to get things back on track.
We need to build up a head of steam, and currently we&apos;re just always around the corner from that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Should be an easy fix,&quot; Larry said.
&quot;I&apos;ve got plenty of Silicon Valley experience in going fast and disrupting things.
All you have to do is present the facts a little bit differently.&quot;
Larry grabbed a rolodex labeled &quot;expansion contacts&quot; off of John&apos;s desk and flipped it open.
&quot;Like look at this, you have... 16 total contacts?
Wait, you&apos;ve been working on this for 2 years and you only have 16 names?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&apos;s difficult to find people who will return my calls after the unpaid bill stories leaked out,&quot; John said defensively.
&quot;Every single one of those is a good, active contact!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;OK.
OK.
That&apos;s perfect, actually,&quot; Larry said.
&quot;So you can tell them that you&apos;re in active conversations with 16 different markets and that they&apos;re very promising contacts.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I said contacts, not markets,&quot; John said.
&quot;And some of them haven&apos;t gone very deep- just a day of drinks and talking to them about the open system.
Some of them are partners or live in the same city.&quot;</p>
<p>Larry lit up.
&quot;Well, a contact who you get drinks with is the only kind I really care about!
Anyway, just say they&apos;re all active market discussions.
We&apos;re an open system. 
In theory every single one of them could start up their own club or link up with somebody else to do it, right?
And every club is its own market.
It&apos;s not really a lie, it&apos;s just the most optimistic scenario possible, which is what everybody who still believes in the concept of &apos;independent soccer&apos; wants to believe in anyway.&quot;</p>
<p>John pursed his lips and nodded.
&quot;That could work.
It would be nice if we had more confirmed expansions in the meanwhile.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why is everyone waiting another year?&quot; Larry asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Cashflow issues or organizational readiness.
There&apos;s only so many people at these groups and it takes time to find a stadium, hire technical staff, make sure housing is worked out properly, and so on.
If you rushed some of them they might struggle to even make payroll on no amenities.&quot;</p>
<p>Larry leaned back and looked at the ceiling.
&quot;You just need a little capital to make those sorts of problems go away,&quot; he mused.</p>
<p>&quot;Which is what we&apos;re all short of,&quot; John said.
&quot;It wouldn&apos;t hurt to get some of those expansion fees- sorry, mandatory share purchases- in a little sooner.
Heck, if we had more teams in I&apos;d love to pocket some exit fees even more.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That really is my favorite aspect of the system,&quot; Larry mused.
&quot;You have to forfeit your shares if you leave and you pay more for that privilege than you paid to enter the league in the first place.
I think we might actually be the first company in the world to be making bank on what is technically a negative valuation.
I&apos;m already dreaming up other applications for that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Focus,&quot; John said. 
&quot;We need to make money now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Easy fix,&quot; Larry said. He leaned over again and punched in one of the numbers that was listed as joining the league two years from now.
&quot;Ivan!
Hey, it&apos;s Larry calling on behalf of John.
Yeah, about next year- right, cash on hand- listen, the chairman and I were talking and he has your back.
Mhm.
Right, just like when they injected money into Snag Village when they ran out midseason- you get into any trouble that first year and he&apos;ll keep you afloat.
No, it&apos;s- what if we knocked off 20% of your expansion fee if you did it a year early, too?
Right, I meant the mandatory share purchase, there is never an expansion fee when you&apos;re inserted into ANAL.
OK! Great, it&apos;s a deal.&quot;
He hung up and turned back to John.</p>
<p>&quot;You do a few more of those and you&apos;ll have your shot in the arm and that confirmed club count will be way up,&quot; he said with a grin.</p>
<p>The silence stretched out between the two of them before John finally spoke.
&quot;Did you actually confirm with the chairman that he was good for that?
You know how badly his wife took him to the cleaners during that time period when we weren&apos;t paying the r-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Relax,&quot; Larry said.
&quot;It literally doesn&apos;t matter whether they collapse at the end of the season and go out of business entirely.
All that matters is that they <em>start</em> the season when we hand in the team sheet to the federation and while we talk to sponsors.
It&apos;s basically like check kiting, except the government would be fine with soccer dying entirely and so this is legal.&quot;</p>
<p>John bit his tongue.
It was stupid, and maybe it would kill the league, but by the time that happened he probably would have been fired by the chairman anyway.
Might as well roll with it while the money wasn&apos;t as bad as it could be.</p>
<p>John gave Larry a smile that didn&apos;t reach up to his eyes.
&quot;Thanks, Larry,&quot; he said.
&quot;If you could get out of here, I need to call into that podcast now.&quot;</p>
<p>Larry nodded and walked out.
As the phone rang, John noticed an old post-it note out of the corner of his eye.
<em>Find out exactly where Larry Gary is getting his money from.</em>
Perhaps some question were better left unanswered.</p>
