                                <p>The doorbell rang while Larry was in the middle of a call. 
He&apos;d never had much of an opinion regarding the soft, windchime-like tones of the bell. 
They did the job: played a generic little tune that echoed delicately through the whole house, not entirely unintrusive and yet delicately insistent, like a well-trained butler.</p>
<p>And, like that non-existent butler- Larry was good with his money, but he wasn&apos;t quite good enough to afford that kind of pointed skill in his staff, so he&apos;d never bothered hiring anyone to fill the role- this chime of the bell carried with it a subtle hint of ominous import.</p>
<p>Something in Larry&apos;s life was about to go wrong.</p>
<p>It was a silly thing to feel. Didn&apos;t fit at all with the eternal optimist attitude he lived his life by. 
He was a Can-Do, Fake-it-&apos;til-you-Make-it kinda guy. 
If he wanted to make a million bucks from expansion fees, he&apos;d chat with ten team owners a day, give &apos;em the hard sell with a thousand-watt-smile, and have them all itching to enter ANAL by the end, all without shedding a single drop of sweat, blood, or tears. 
He loved his job. 
He was good at it. 
People liked him.  </p>
<p>But he couldn&apos;t shake the sensation of impending doom that little doorbell jingle had given him.</p>
<p>The final tone of the bell faded into a hollow kind of silence that ballooned out to fill the yawning emptiness of the house. 
A chill literally ran down his spine, and that had never happened before.</p>
<p>âSorry, Jim,â he said into the receiver. 
âI&apos;m gonna have to get back to you on this. 
Appreciate the hustle, though. 
I&apos;ll email you the pertinent details.â</p>
<p>He touched his thumb to the âend callâ button, slid the phone into the back pocket of his expensive khaki slacks, and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>He wasn&apos;t one to back away from a threat. 
And this wasn&apos;t a threat. 
It was just the doorbell, for Pete&apos;s sake. 
It was probably just someone selling new aluminum siding, or a subscription to some outdoorsy camping catalogueâyou know, the folks who didn&apos;t have any clue that all the real money to be made was in soccer leagues.</p>
<p>It wasn&apos;t Girl Scout Cookie season, either.
So, for sure, whoever was on the other side of that door wasn&apos;t anyone who could out-earn him.</p>
<p>Still, a cold lump settled somewhere between his heart and his stomach as he made his way down the stairs. 
Late afternoon sunlight filtered through the cut crystal window of the front door. The rainbow sparks it threw on the hardwood floor and eggshell walls were broken by a vague, crystal-warped figure.</p>
<p>Larry&apos;s hand trembled as he reached to unlock the deadbolt.</p>
<p>He opened the door.</p>
<p>A bored-looking reed of a man stood on his front porch. 
He was of middle height, slightly balding, with a thin brown mustache over his lip and squared glasses in rose-gold frames sliding down his long nose. 
He looked just shy of forty, but his impeccable gray suit and small leather briefcase said he aspired to appear older and more authoritative.</p>
<p>He blinked at Larry once upon the door opening, then nodded once, sharply.</p>
<p>âLarry Gary?â he said. His voice sounded like it was made of cardboard.</p>
<p>âUh, yes. 
I mean, yeah. 
Yeah, that&apos;s me,â Larry said. 
Come on, Lar. 
Don&apos;t let this little weasel throw you off your game. 
âYou&apos;re looking for Larry, I&apos;m your Gary.â</p>
<p>He gave a little finger gun action and a wide-yet-lopsided smile to seal the deal, as it were. 
The deal that said, âI&apos;m not freaked out by your doorbell ringing technique.â</p>
<p>The man on his front porch ignored this and opened his briefcase with a crisp snap. 
He pulled a single sheet of thick cream paper from the dark depths, glanced at it through the glasses that were now practically dangling off the tip of his nose, and then handed it to Larry.</p>
<p>âYou&apos;re being served. Have a good afternoon.â</p>
<p>Larry glanced at the page. 
Words jumped out at him, their meanings at once piercing and numbing. 
<em>Restraining.</em>
<em>Court order.</em>
<em>Divorce.</em></p>
<p>âDivorce?â Larry said. 
His voice rasped in his throat. 
âLesley? Hey. Hey, wait a minute, man.â</p>
<p>But the man had already climbed back into his sleek black car and pulled away.</p>
<p>Larry let the arm holding the paper fall to his side. 
Divorce. 
Yes, Lesley had left him, but he&apos;d assumed things would get patched up, somehow. 
No, he hadn&apos;t done anything to make that patching happen himself, but who could expect him to? 
He was a busy guy! 
He had millions of dollars to score off unsuspecting soccer team owners. 
Frankly, it was up to Lesley to win him back, right? 
He was a catch!</p>
<p>Divorce.</p>
<p>Fucking hell, the word made him feel something he&apos;d never felt, not in his entire life.</p>
<p>He felt like a loser.</p>
<p>Realizing he was still standing in his open doorway where all the neighbors could witness his fish-like gapingâ <em>catch and release, how insulting</em>â and humiliation, he swung the door closed. 
The rainbow sparkles fell over his face and dazzled in his eyes. 
He blinked. 
Hard.</p>
<p>When he&apos;d wiped away the stupid tears, he found himself staring at the little sock puppet he&apos;d made of Lesley. 
It sat on the shelf next to where he kept his keys, a little slumped over for lack of internal support, but still smiling serenely at him.</p>
<p>He&apos;d given that puppet real shares in ANAL after Lesley walked out on him. 
Ridiculous and stupid, perhaps, but it had been a way to push away all the bad feelings her leaving had stirred up.</p>
<p>The horrible paper the little lawyer had given him fluttered to the floor.</p>
<p>Before he&apos;d even thought to do it, Larry pushed away from the door and swept the puppet up off the shelf. 
He slid it onto his fist and wiggled his fingers to settle into the articulation point of the mouth.</p>
<p>âLesley,â he whispered. 
With his other hand, he stroked the twisted yarn of her hair. 
âYou&apos;d never leave me, right, babe?â</p>
<p>Sock puppet Lesley tilted a smile at him. 
Her button eyes glinted in the rainbow sparkles.</p>
<p>Then she opened her mouth.</p>
<p>âYou&apos;re fucking your whole life up, Larry. 
You&apos;re throwing it all away on shady soccer deals and blow. 
Anyone would leave you, babycakes.â</p>
<p>Larry ground his molars together. 
âShut up. That&apos;s not true.â</p>
<p>âWhy can&apos;t you be a wholesome family man? 
Settle down, stand by your woman, take the kids for pizza, all that jazz? 
You&apos;re a disgrace, Larrison Garrison.â</p>
<p>â<em>Shut up!</em>â</p>
<p>He flung the puppet down. 
It landed next to the divorce paper, where it grinned up at him horribly.</p>
<p>Larry spun on his heel and marched away, back to the stairs. 
He took them two at a time, each footfall thudding hard enough to rattle the pictures on the walls. 
Pictures of himself and Lesley on a date, getting married, on their honeymoon, on vacation.</p>
<p>He stared deliberately at the carpeted rise of the next stair and stomped harder. 
Things were not falling apart. 
Everything was <em>fine</em>. 
People <em>loved</em> him.</p>
<p>And he knew just how to show it.</p>
<p>He&apos;d show Lesleyâboth the real one and the backstabbing one made of a gym sockâhow wholesome he could be.</p>
<p>Back in his office, he grabbed his phone out of his pocket and dialed a number he knew by heart.</p>
