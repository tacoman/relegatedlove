                                <p>The annual meeting of the Autonomous National Alliance of Leagues was even more tense than usual, Kimberly Telly mused.
Perhaps it was the fact that their champion, Ted Easterly, had gone missing months ago.
Without his valiant posts at birdsite.io, the fortunes of the Alliance had collapsed almost immediately.
Apparently, hashtags really were the problem facing the movement- more than business fundamentals or network effects, the league had been sustained by generous souls willing to say #ProRelForUSA.
Once that had stopped, the clubs had begun to leave.</p>
<p>Of course, the fact that the chairman of the board was holding a gun to his head wasn&apos;t helping the mood much either. 
If he could just wait for everyone else at the table to collapse first, he could walk free.
He just had to survive until then.
Just had to <em>not</em> get shot.</p>
<p>&quot;Well... certainly, we&apos;ve lost our primary marketing asset, one of our most reliable revenue sources, and any media buzz,&quot; the chairman burbled.
&quot;But the people must be on our side!
We&apos;ve stuck true to our principles!&quot;</p>
<p>Telly shook his head.
&quot;The only people who are still following us are three podcasters who all live in Chattanooga.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The ones who sent us hate mail every day that claim we&apos;re ruining their lives and destroying the movement entrusted to us?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, them. It is nice to have somebody who cares, at least.&quot;</p>
<p>The room went quiet for a full minute.
Finally, the chairman cleared his throat.
&quot;We could put out another book list-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What we need is money,&quot; Telly interjected.
&quot;Almost nobody in this room has paid their bills.&quot;
&quot;Everyone pays up today, we can clear out a lot of outstanding debts to hotels and liquor stores and referees or whoever else we&apos;ve been stiffing and can move on and get the season going again smoothly.
Maybe we could even run an entire season where nobody commits any federal crimes!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just so long as that doesn&apos;t include all of those graphic designers from the clubs the league ran?&quot; the chairman asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Sure, technically those clubs went bankrupt, and I&apos;m still doing business with you, so we&apos;re well past the point of being concerned with petty moral obligations,&quot; Telly said glumly.</p>
<p>One man cleared his throat at the corner of the table.
&quot;The soccer side of the business is not making money regardless of us paying our bills.
If we&apos;re going to get up to sustainability, we&apos;re going to have to start getting more creative.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I agree with him!&quot; another voice chimed in.</p>
<p>Telly groaned.
Larry Gary was a tech mogul in the worst sense of the term: disruptive and amoral, but without a billion dollars to show for it.
Every so often, he appeared to remember that he was running a soccer team- but those brief glimmers of lucidity were becoming fewer and farther between as the months ground on.
How exactly he had made a successful tech business was anyone&apos;s guess- Telly suspected that he had found it fruitful to repeatedly pull investors off of the street, but he refused to spend any of his precious time digging deeper into that fool&apos;s errand.</p>
<p>Worse still, Larry Gary&apos;s wife Lesley had recently left him.
Nobody could quite be sure why, but Larry had since taken to wearing a sockpuppet on his hand that he had named after her.
Legally speaking, the sockpuppet owned a second football team and had a vote in all board matters.
When Telly had attempted to challenge this, the chairman had vetoed it- contingent on a promise that the sockpuppet would never vote to oust him.</p>
<p>&quot;What if we all simply ran good soccer clubs?&quot; Telly asked.
&quot;I&apos;ve done it for ten years.
Practically pays for itself, almost, whenever we don&apos;t get bored and call up La Liga sides to see if they want to hang out in the US.
Maybe we could even have an entire season where nobody commits any federal crimes!
What do you all say?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not nearly enough money for as quickly as we need capital,&quot; Larry said.
&quot;We&apos;re going to have to get really creative if we&apos;re going to move the cash we need.
Trust me.
I&apos;ve done this six times before,
I can certainly do it again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Larry&apos;s been doing this for years!&quot; Lesley chimed in.</p>
<p>Telly glanced around the table.
The traveling salesman was hanging on Larry&apos;s every word.
George looked calm and not at all like he wanted to drop somebody into a toilet, which was practically raving approval coming from him.
The chairman was stroking his chin in thought, while all of the new members of the board looked like they were intrigued.</p>
<p>Whatever Larry was planning was going to carry the votes.
Now Telly had to both not get shot and avoid getting sent to jail with the rest of these people.
It was bound to be an even longer season.</p>
