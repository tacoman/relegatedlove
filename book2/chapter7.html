                                <p><em>Some time ago</em></p>
<p>Benjamin Quick sat on his knees before commissioner Donovan Grabber.
&quot;So,&quot; the commissioner murmured, &quot;you finally realized that working for your precious national team ultimately means working for me.&quot;</p>
<p>Ben cast his eyes downward.
A mere month ago, working with Grabber would have been unthinkable, equivalent to cavorting with the devil.
That was before Ted had broken up with him and made it clear that promotion and relegation was more important to him than their life together.
He took a deep breath, then lifted his eyes up to the commissioner.</p>
<p>&quot;I&apos;ll do anything you ask, so long as you empower me to take my revenge,&quot; he said.
&quot;I want to see Ted dead before me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;His foolish ambitions were already a shambling husk,&quot; Grabber purred.</p>
<p>&quot;No.
I want <em>him</em> dead.
Not his dreams, not his ideals- him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; Grabber said.
He was hardly above working with murderous psychos or taking their money.
Hell, a lot of them bought tickets.
&quot;Stand.
In order for you to accomplish your goals, you&apos;re going to need power... significantly more power.&quot;</p>
<p>Grabber wordlessly led Quick to an elevator that took them all the way to the basement of the League&apos;s headquarters.
Deep within the bowels of the building, there was a machine with a man-sized glass tube.
Many power cables and hoses fed the curious monstrosity.
Grabber gestured for Ben to enter the tube.</p>
<p>&quot;As everyone knows, leagues rise and die based on how mean people are on the Birdsite,&quot; Grabber noted.
&quot;The Alliance will soon fall to the veritable flood of negative posts we send their way, and then the reform movement shall be crushed.
This Collector of Crap Kontent will-&quot;</p>
<p>Ben suddenly collapsed from the force of the world&apos;s largest involuntary groan, the universe demanding counterbalance for contrivance.</p>
<p>&quot;Ahem. 
It will collect all of the worst soccer-related content from the birdsite, convert it into gaseous form, and then flood the chamber with it.
You&apos;ll become a human embodiment of the worst of the scene, a potent weapon able to purge the sanity of any who read your posts.&quot;</p>
<p>Ben picked himself up and stood up tall.
&quot;Let&apos;s do this, then.&quot;</p>
<p>Grabber flipped a switch.
The machine connected up to Birdsite and began to pull down every post it could from reform-minded hashtags, from anti-reform accounts, and a few corporate accounts for good measure.
A loud humming filled the room as condensers rendered the posts into physical form, then superheated them up to eye-watering temperatures.
The gas began to flow in as Ben bit his tongue to avoid crying out in case it hurt.
Soon the entire room was obscured, with neither party able to see each other.</p>
<p>Improbably despite the temperature, the process didn&apos;t hurt at all.
Ben actually experienced it as a sort of cool breeze.
Finally, the gas cleared, and the tube opened up automatically.
&quot;Gotta be honest, Don, I don&apos;t feel any different at all.
Nice way to cool off during the heat, at least.&quot;</p>
<p>Grabber frowned.
&quot;Stay in there another minute please,&quot; he said.
The process was supposed to cause some level of mental and physical decay in exchange for granting power, but Quick seemed to not be affected at all.
Grabber checked the data inputs and shook his head.
Quick&apos;s own posts accounted for at least 20% of the data input.
That was never going to work.
What other data sources could he add in?</p>
<p>He pulled up the data sources tab.
Pro-monarchy Birdsite, that should be good.
Everyone who was still interacting with Joe Rogan online, for or against, probably had no filter.
It was still missing something.
He scrolled down until a single item stood out, simply labeled &quot;GAMERS&quot;.
Without hesitation, he added it to the queue and immediately fired up the machine again.</p>
<p>This time, Ben&apos;s screaming was heard loud and clear through the smoke.
Plasma danced along the glass, the supercharged energy well beyond limits that would kill most people.
&quot;STOP IT STOP IT PLEASE I BEG OF YOU!&quot; Ben shrieked.
Grabber simply grinned.
He hadn&apos;t lifted his boot up to show mercy to any other fan who had come in begging him for assistance, and he certainly wouldn&apos;t start now.</p>
<p>Finally, the smoke cleared.
Ben&apos;s skin had turned a sickly green hue, a forked tongue flicking out nervously.
&quot;Whaaaaat have you donnnne to meeeeeee?&quot; he hissed.</p>
<p>&quot;I have given you exactly what you asked for.
The power to destroy those in your path.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can feeeeel the sssstrength in my body,&quot; Ben said.
&quot;I will killll Ted with thisssss powerrrr.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&apos;s all good and well,&quot; Donovan said.
&quot;But I mostly need you to keep posting things on the Birdsite that will make the reform movement look stupid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I willll argueee your caseee.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Hell</em> no.
I need you to keep arguing the reform side, much like how you have been, only moreso.&quot;</p>
<p>The forked tongue went in and out as Ben considered.
&quot;Youuu do not waaant me to publicly ssssswitch?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you kidding?
You and Ted as a team were the third best thing that ever happened for us in terms of the movement looking stupid, and that&apos;s only because the Alliance and the Deltas exist to take the first two.
Now come on, we have a board meeting to get to.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Months later...</em></p>
<p>Ben stood triumphantly over the bodies of Noruhl and Easterly, then dialed out to the commissioner.
&quot;Iiit isss finissshed,&quot; he rasped.
&quot;The traitorsss are finaly finissshed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good, Benjamin.
I knew I could count on you.
Now, listen.
We&apos;ve finally located where one of our other old friends has left around a certain disk.
It could be a disaster if the wrong person got ahold of it- and right now the Alliance has the only copy.&quot;</p>
<p>Ben licked the air, taking in the aroma of his kill.
&quot;Ssssurely you cannot mean- but he issss not even in the countryyyy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Correct.
He doesn&apos;t give a damn about the thing.
But rumor has it one of the other thorns in our side is attempting to sneak their way in and steal it.&quot;</p>
<p>Ben snarled.
&quot;Theyyy will not even live to see this dissssk, let alone usssse it againsssst usss.&quot;</p>
