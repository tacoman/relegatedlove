                                <p>It was a hot day in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and George was feeling testy.
The referees had been mistreating him and his team all year.
Why should he even be dealing with it anymore?
He had a handshake agreement with a new, much better league anyway.
It was time to send everyone else down to earth while his star shone brighter than ever.</p>
<p>George&apos;s team had been steadily absorbing all of his pent-up rage.
It was hard for them not to, in all fairness: every time a coach failed to play his beloved firstborn son, Steven, the child who had made him a father, that coach was promptly fired and George took over.
When coaches were present, George would angrily berate them anytime there wasn&apos;t a win, or anytime there were too few chances for Steven to score.
The opportunities afforded to Steven must be unlimited as the stars; this was the guiding principle of his team.
And of course if the spares happened to shine a little that was fine too.</p>
<p>On the field, a challenge for the ball went badly, leading to a scrum of players pushing and slapping at each other.
George was instantly enraged.
This sort of behavior from these Chattanoogans was the sort of thing that could easily escalate to him having to rely on one of his spares- and that wasn&apos;t a great idea whether tires or children were in view.
Suddenly, one of the southerners actually punched one of the other players, the pushing and slapping intensifying in its wake.
Honor demanded that George do something about this.
He trundled over to the Chattanooga coach.</p>
<p>&quot;YOU WANT TO GO?&quot; George shouted.
&quot;COME ON!
LET&apos;S GO!
BE A MAN!&quot;</p>
<p>George&apos;s opposite number glanced up and down at him, unimpressed.
&quot;Yeah, sure.
You want to go for a race?
40 yards, there and back.
Unlike some teams in this league we actually keep an ambulance on-site with trained medical staff at all of our games.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;COME ON, YOU COWARD!&quot; George gasped, trying his hardest to provoke his opponent into making the first move.
In the background, the grand melee of all slapfights was finally breaking up as the referee displayed card after card to players, the threat of fines sapping the will to continue.</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;Hm, that&apos;s odd,&quot; I said.
&quot;Tickets for the match against that other Michigan team aren&apos;t on sale yet.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You&apos;re not allowed to go there anyway,&quot; the traveling salesman reprimanded.
&quot;You have a lot of work to do before we&apos;re letting you go.
Demands of the narrative and all that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&apos;s my book!&quot; I said.
&quot;I should be able to keep attending matches regardless of the needs of the plot.
In fact I&apos;m pretty sure I&apos;ll change the plot so I can watch matches if that&apos;s what it takes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Let&apos;s not get into another tired discussion of which side of the fourth wall this version of your consciousness is on.
We have a lot of work to do against the Kleptocracy still, and we need you fully focused for the good of your own team.&quot;
The traveling salesman closed his own laptop and dropped his can of beer into the bin.
&quot;Anyway, I need to go run interference on an investor call for Larry.
Be g- just be yourself but in our favor, OK?&quot;
He walked out.</p>
<p>I bit my lip and switched back to looking at the tickets page.
Why wouldn&apos;t they be on sale? 
I looked for a phone number for the team, took a moment, then called it.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, you&apos;ve reached Michigan&apos;s Professional Soccer Team,&quot; a thick Albanian accent responded.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh, hi, this is John, I was hoping to buy tickets?&quot; I said.</p>
<p>&quot;John?
Well, I&apos;m sorry, there aren&apos;t any tickets on sale right now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why not, though?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our league has been treating us very poorly.
Lots of bad calls by the referees, and after our players were mistreated very badly we were given fines and I am not paying them.
So I told them that we will not be playing our next match until they say we do not have to pay any fines.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh.
That sucks.
I really wanted to watch some local football this weekend.&quot; 
I wasn&apos;t actually local at the time- I was being shipped back and forth between New York and Chicago regularly, with an occasional stopover at league headquarters.
I was putting up with it until I had retrieved what I needed from the league- finding it was taking longer than expected, though.
In the meanwhile, there were advantages to being in a place where everybody would just loudly blab about their plans around people who had no need to know them.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I&apos;m sorry,&quot; George responded.
&quot;We just don&apos;t know if we&apos;re playing or not.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When will you know?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sometime later this week.&quot;</p>
<p>I hung up the phone and began to spin my swivel chair, faster and faster, the world spinning into a blur, my eyes attempting to track individual objects until all focus was lost.
Later this week, huh?</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Four days later</em></p>
<p>&quot;Hi, this is John-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you?
Where are you from?&quot; George asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?
Like I said, my name is John-&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&apos;s very suspicious that you just keep calling every day and asking like this.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Yeah, I&apos;ll bet that it&apos;s suspicious that anybody would actually want to see one of your games this badly.</em>
&quot;I just really want to see some soccer this weekend, what&apos;s so weird about that?
Are you going to play or not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You will find out,&quot; George said, then hung up the phone.</p>
<p>Oh well.
It wasn&apos;t like I could have gotten there anyway.
Something was bothering me about the whole exchange, though.
Why <em>was</em> I so invested?</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;We had a <em>handshake agreement</em>!&quot; George thundered.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, and that was all we had,&quot; Sikadapap said.
&quot;Then we found out that your response to your players fighting is to attempt to join in, back them up online instead of condemning them, and then threaten to not play your remaining matches.
I don&apos;t know what kind of clown show the Alliance is that you can throw your weight around like this without being removed, but the Kleptocracy has <em>standards</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>George was so angry he could practically spit blood.
But there was nothing for it.
Now he had to actually play the remaining matches.
He would be stuck within the Alliance until the end.</p>
