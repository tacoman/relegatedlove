                                <p>John calmly got up from his desk, picked up his phone, walked over to his fishtank, then dropped the phone in.
It sank to the bottom, not a single bubble of air leaking out of it.
A testament to the genius of engineering.
But genius was cold comfort when it paired with madness, when the consequences at last came home.
All that John had now was the knowledge that nobody could call him anymore, at least not for a few days.
He would have the excuse that he had accidentally dropped his phone in the fish tank and simply couldn&apos;t receive or make any calls.</p>
<p>The door opened, and Larry walked in.
&quot;I told you so!&quot; Larry thundered.</p>
<p>&quot;Told me so?
This was all your bad idea to begin with!
&apos;It doesn&apos;t matter whether they collapse at the end of the season&apos;, that&apos;s what you told me.
Well now every single new club we added this year on your recommendation has collapsed in the <em>middle</em> of the season.
So now that we&apos;re in this pickle, what exactly is your plan, Larry?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It hardly matters that they collapsed in the middle, either,&quot; Larry said nonchalantly.
&quot;We started the season over the minimum of 8, we kept sanctioning that way.
We won!
Now we can just do it again next year.
I&apos;ve got a lot of experience with this, all we need to do is find another round of investors and keep the party train going.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh yes, brilliant,&quot; John seethed.
&quot;We have all the press of being the league that can&apos;t pay the bills already.
Now we&apos;re having to reconfigure the entire season with 2 months left because we lost a ton of teams and have to alter history to compensate.
Every investor with money is asking why they shouldn&apos;t go to the Oligarchy instead, and the ones <em>without</em> money are asking for more of your special deals.
And all this without you even being up to date on your dues!&quot;</p>
<p>Larry was caught up short.
He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, then re-opened them.
&quot;That&apos;s a defamatory statement and I&apos;m going to have to insist that you stop right now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Defamation,&quot; John asked, gesticulating incredulously.
&quot;There&apos;s nobody to defame you to.
We&apos;re in front of a bunch of goldfish.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, and they have attention spans and fiscal sense comparable to my usual investors, so I must insist that you stop using such language in front of them.
The Alliance has a flexible payment schedule and my clubs are allowed to pay our dues as we see fit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Provided you&apos;re paid up before each season, yes. 
You haven&apos;t paid a cent since this season started, and that&apos;s besides the six figure loan that Inequity Football made last year that you still haven&apos;t paid back.
You&apos;re technically not even a member in good standing.
I could have you expelled from the league right at the end of the season if I wanted.&quot;
He narrowed his eyes.
&quot;In fact, maybe I should.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You can&apos;t do that,&quot; Larry said.
&quot;I am a class A shareholder in this organization and even if I don&apos;t pay my bills, provide consistent healthcare and workers comp for my employees, allow them to get injured without coverage, post NDA-covered material to the Internet, allow a team doctor to sleep in their car because they haven&apos;t been paid for months, host games without ambulances, operate three separate ponzi schemes that resemble football clubs, or otherwise fulfill any of my contractual obligations, you can&apos;t expel me from the league.&quot;</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to either party, the fish in the tank was speaking simultaneously with Larry:
&quot;1001 Football Crimes is a work of fiction.
The story, all names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this production are fictitious. 
No identification with actual persons (living or deceased), places, buildings, and products is intended or should be inferred.&quot;
Regrettably, the fish&apos;s metatextual enlightenment would never be known to anyone within its world, as the language of a fish is impossible to convey to humans in a way that could be comprehended by them.
As the sole being in the universe who was aware that its world was in fact a form of cosmic absurdity, it formed a sort of supreme Cassandra, the only one who could have explained that within a short time, you, the dear reader, would read the end of your experience of this book, consigning all the beings within to a sort of cessation of existence.
The memories that would echo the original would depart from the reality of the work, and only a sort of kafkaesque distortion would live on within your own brain.
The fish was forced to know this, to know that at least in this world, some creatures <em>could</em> go to a sort of afterlife.
But this one was doomed, and need I even explain why?
No- let it be left unsaid, so that the fish&apos;s task not be subverted, its damnation not made futile.
Let us leave the tank.</p>
<p>&quot;If your bills are not paid by the end of this week, you&apos;re expelled,&quot; John said.</p>
<p>&quot;We&apos;ll just see about that,&quot; Larry said as his phone began to ring.
Lesley was calling- it was always nice to hear from your literal partner in crime.
It must be because she was coming back to him!
<em>We&apos;re going to see you fired, John. And when we do, I&apos;m going to be the king of this league.</em></p>
